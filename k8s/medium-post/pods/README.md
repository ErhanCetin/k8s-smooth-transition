- You can deploy all pod yaml files like 
 > kubectl apply -f <pod_name> <yaml file-name>

Please pay attention :
 After you created pod , you will not access over browser.Because there is no services yaml for all component. 
 That's why ports are not published to be used. Those yaml files are just to use in articles. Of course , you can create in your minikube 
 and check the logs , labels and so on.
